"# Algorithm Ford-Fulkerson" 
The Maximum Flow Problem in Networks (or Network Maximum Flow Problem) is a well-known optimization problem in graph theory and operations research. It deals with finding the maximum rate of flow that can be pushed through a network from a source node to a destination node while satisfying the capacity constraints of the edges (or links) in the network.

In the Maximum Flow Problem, a network is modeled as a directed graph, where each edge has a capacity limit representing the maximum amount of flow that can pass through it. The goal is to find a flow through the network that is feasible (i.e., it does not exceed the capacity of any edge) and is maximum (i.e., it is not possible to push more flow through the network without violating the capacity constraints).

The Maximum Flow Problem has numerous applications, including network traffic management, water distribution systems, supply chain management, and more. It can be solved using various algorithms, including the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, and the Push-Relabel algorithm.

Here is a brief description of the Maximum Flow Problem in English:

Maximum Flow Problem in Networks

Given a directed graph representing a network with nodes and edges, where each edge has a capacity limit, find the maximum rate of flow that can be pushed from a source node to a destination node while satisfying the capacity constraints of the edges.

The input to the problem consists of:

A directed graph G with n nodes and m edges.
A source node s and a destination node t.
A capacity c(u, v) for each edge (u, v) in the graph, representing the maximum amount of flow that can pass through that edge.
The output is the maximum flow value f that can be pushed from s to t while satisfying the capacity constraints of the edges.

The Maximum Flow Problem can be solved using algorithms like the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which repeatedly finds augmenting paths (paths from s to t with available capacity) and pushes flow along them until no more augmenting paths exist. The resulting flow is then the maximum flow from s to t.
