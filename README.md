## Maximum Flow Problem in a Network

The maximum flow problem (or network flow problem) is a well-known optimization problem in graph theory and operations research. It involves finding the maximum rate of flow that can be pushed through a network from a source node to a sink node, while respecting the capacity constraints of the edges (or links) in the network.

In the maximum flow problem, a network is modeled as a directed graph, where each edge has a capacity constraint, representing the maximum amount of flow that can pass through it. The goal is to find a flow through the network that is feasible (i.e., does not exceed the capacity of any edge) and maximal (i.e., it is not possible to push more flow through the network without violating the capacity constraints).

The maximum flow problem has numerous applications, including network traffic management, water distribution systems, supply chain management, and more. It can be solved using a variety of algorithms, including the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, and the Push-Relabel algorithm.

### Problem Statement

**Given:** A directed graph G representing a network with nodes and edges, where each edge has a capacity constraint.

**Find:** The maximum rate of flow that can be pushed from a source node s to a sink node t, while satisfying the capacity constraints of the edges.

**Input:**

* A directed graph G with n nodes and m edges.
* A source node s and a sink node t.
* The capacity c(u, v) of each edge (u, v) in the graph, representing the maximum amount of flow that can pass through that edge.

**Output:**

* The maximum flow value f that can be pushed from s to t while satisfying the capacity constraints of the edges.

### Algorithms

The maximum flow problem can be solved using algorithms such as the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. This algorithm works by repeatedly finding augmenting paths (paths from s to t that have available capacity) and pushing flow along them until no more augmenting paths exist. The resulting flow is then the maximum flow from s to t.

### Applications

* Network traffic management
* Water distribution systems
* Supply chain management
* Transportation planning
* Image segmentation
* Bipartite matching
